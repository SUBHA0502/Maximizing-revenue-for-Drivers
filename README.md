# Maximizing-revenue-for-Drivers
Maximizing Revenue for Drivers is a data analysis project focused on identifying payment trends and optimizing fare strategies to enhance driver earnings. Using Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed trip data, removed outliers, and conducted statistical tests to uncover insights on fare amounts, payment methods, and customer behavior.

## Credit & Inspiration
This project is inspired by the guidance provided on the Tech Classes YouTube channel, created by Ayushi Mishra. Her tutorial played a key role in shaping the approach and methodology used in this analysis.

## Technologies Used
* Python (for data analysis)

* Anaconda (environment management)

* Jupyter Notebook (for interactive exploration)

* Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

* Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

* SciPy (hypothesis testing)

## Dataset
We used a subset of the NYC Yellow Taxi Trip (https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) records, focusing on relevant features such as:

* passenger_count

* trip_distance

* payment_type (Cash/Card)

* fare_amount

* trip_duration

## Methodology
* Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering – Removed anomalies and prepared the dataset for analysis.

* Descriptive Analysis – Identified trends in payment methods and fare amounts.

* Hypothesis Testing – Conducted a T-test to examine the statistical significance of payment type on fare amount.

* Visualizations & Interpretations – Explored fare distribution, trip distances, and customer payment preferences.

## Key Findings
* Card payments dominate taxi transactions (67.5%).

* Longer trips and higher fares tend to be paid via credit card.

* Hypothesis testing confirms that payment method impacts fare amounts.

## Future Improvements
* To enhance the analysis further, we plan to investigate the relationship between fare amount and trip distance using Linear Regression. This enhancement aims to:

* Identify how trip distance influences fare amount quantitatively.

* Build a predictive model to estimate expected fares based on trip distance.

* Improve insights for optimizing pricing strategies for taxi drivers.
This improvement is planned for future implementation and will be incorporated in later updates of the project.

## Recommendations
To boost driver revenue, we suggest:
* Encouraging credit card payments through incentives.

* Streamlining payment convenience & security to build trust.

* Educating customers about the advantages of cashless transactions.
